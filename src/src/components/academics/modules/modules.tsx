        review: "I have to say, this is the module that I miss the most as the semester has ended. I have met and had the chance to work with some of the coolest people in CS. The best teammates I have met in CS.\nGrade breakdown:\nWeekly writeups: 10%\nAssignment 1 (UI): 10%\nAssignment 2 (presentation): 10%\nAssignment 3 (GenAI): 20%\nFinal project: 50%\nYou will get to learn a lot of things that other software engineering modules miss out. Not the proper CI/CD pipelines, or the code quality, this module teaches you the things that really matters: UI/UX, branding, ideation, etc. What would be a better module review than pasting my last reflection here!\nI am glad to have taken this mod (?)\nMake a product. Users are who you should be targeting (obviously?). That decides what you should do to set up your success. Building an app goes beyond just the technical implementation.\nUI/UX is one of the most important factors determining the success of your app. Not what technologies you use, or how cool your idea is. It is UI/UX that forms the first impression and determines whether your users can discover your cool ideas, and whether they will come back the second time. In our final project, our first prototype was built with a rather simple, easy-to-code UI, which did not highlight our app's strengths well. We decided to change to the polaroid UI, with changes to highlight different aspects (from our first prototype) of a photo album, which then made the purpose of our app clearer: memory keepsake.\nGoing beyond the first impression, the idea behind the app is very important. While one may be very clear on an approach to a problem, it is important to verify that the problem exists, and users would make good use of the solution. In our assignment 1, we envisioned our app to be separate from job portals, where one would only find reviews and general application statuses. However, after user interviews, we realised users would not make good use of our app, due to its lack of integration with job application processes. We decided to go beyond a review site and integrate with job portals. Ensuring that your app is what the target user wants is very important in setting up your success.\nKnowing your competitors is an important skill for the survival of your app. As a small group, would your idea be good enough to survive against similar products by tech giants? Practically, CS3216 is not long enough to tell the answer. But we can readily learn from others' stories: Sau Sheong's first startup story is a prime example of how important this is. Maybe your app solves a good problem, your users need it, but it may die out because it is too easily replicable. That sets a caution for GenAI-based apps: are they easily replicable, especially by the LLM authors? Is your idea unique enough to set your app apart?\nAlright, you have a very unique idea, and you know your target users want it. But there needs to be a bridge between your app and your users: marketing. This is what sets apart my final project from my other side projects. Proper marketing sets a leap for the project, from just an idea, to an app with real users and real impact. It involves not just spreading by word of mouth, but also writing social media posts, emails, etc, all of which, as a silent online citizen, I am not too comfortable with. But all these are necessary to ensure that my app reaches where it should be.\nHandling errors is a very important skill, in both big apps and small apps. One would argue that for a small app, spaghetti code has more benefits that proper software engineering processes. It is true to a large extent. For example, ssh and git pull from the VM instance would save more time than setting up proper CI/CD pipelines (especially for teams with no experience in proper CI/CD â€¦), while proper CI/CD pipelines minimises bugs in deployment, which is important for larger applications. However, too much spaghetti code can hamper development. This is one of the aspects I was adamant with my team about: your code has to be ready for deployment. Are you still hardcoding localhost? When your code fails, will I know what went wrong, or did you just use pokemon error catching (one big try-catch block)? Will I have to copy paste your 20 lines of code in the next feature, or will I just need one line to call a function? While some software engineering processes can be skipped for faster speed of development, a baseline code quality must be maintained so that spaghetti code does not actually slow down the speed of development.\nI have to end off with a caution for CS3216: the pressure. Dealing with pressure is not something I just learned in CS3216, but something I must have already had before coming for CS3216. Working tirelessly on something, only to receive some negative feedback. When you think you have finished most of the things and can take a break, something, some bug, pops up. But what drove me through is, first knowing that effort is not what solely determines the outcome. And more importantly, maintaining a cheerful spirit keeps the team going. I'm not sure if our team is truly less overloaded than other teams, or if we are just maintaining good team dynamics, but for sure, happiness is key :). On a related note, handling disagreements is something I have been learning, and still trying to learn through CS3216. I do have to admit, I may appear assertive at times, and sometimes am not so receptive to others' ideas, and this can easily upset others. Maintaining the critical balance between getting the team to move forward and pausing to listen to others' disagreements is still something I am trying to learn.",

However, there is a very cool project component, where you would have to learn a lot of new tools to tackle it. Personally, I have learnt a lot from doing that project. One thing is the microservice architecture, where each functionality is abstracted out as a microservice. You can then use your own framework of your choice to develop the microservice, instead of being stuck with the same framework for the entire project. Another thing I learnt is the tools used for the project, including Redis for temporary data storage, Nginx as reverse proxy, and RabbitMQ as message broker. In fact, I have applied some of these to my CS3216 projects. I have also learnt the security features necessary to design a code executor.\nWhat I do not enjoy about the module is what the module advertises to teach - the design patterns and principles. I could not bear how boring the content was, and decided to jam the content right before the final exam.\nThe teaching team was unclear about their grading rubrics, especially for milestone 1 of the project. We did not get a good grade for the first milestone, and had to sit down to discuss the grading rubrics with the teaching team.\nFinal word of wisdom: do make sure that manage time well for the project. Make sure that everyone is on the same pace, and plan to finish the milestones early. There tends to be errors and blockers, especially for deployment of the project, so do make sure to give yourselves ample time to debug and fix the errors.",

If in JC, you just learned about long-run distribution, here you learn way more than that. You would start out with probabilistic basics, one thing being calculating probabilities of past states given the current state. Then of course long-run distribution, or more formally, limiting distribution, as well as transient states and recurrent states. You would learn about first-step analysis, which can be used to derive a lot of properties in the long run. In fact, first half of the semester revolves around this concept of first-step analysis. You would then learn about one specific application of this: gambler's ruin. In the second half of the semester, you would learn about various applications of Markov process, like branching process, pagerank algorithm, simulations. Regular Markov chain is one of the most important concepts, as you would have to derive a lot of properties based on a regular Markov chain. We then end the course with Poisson distribution, and how it is related to concepts in stochastic processes.\nGrade breakdown:\nTutorial participation: 10%\nHomework: 10%\nMidterm: 30%\nFinals: 50%\nThe content is not really difficult to understand.

Do not be discouraged by the first lecture on ethics, that is only for the first lecture. I thoroughly enjoyed the module. We started out with knowledge representation and how to go about generating knowledge from known statements. Then, we moved on to online search algorithms, those that work in problems where the environment is not fully observable. We then moved on with constraint satisfaction problem - choosing a set of values while satisfying constraints. A lot of lectures were on probability: Bayesian network - representing probabilistic events, Bayesian causal network - representing causality, decision network and decision tree - representing cases where human decisions are part of the situation. We learned about Markov decision process, where probabilistic events are repeated. Finally, we learned about reinforcement learning, which are model-free agents that learn the optimal policy.\nGrade breakdown:\nHomework: 20%\nTutorials: 10%\nQuizzes: 20%\nMidterm exam: 25%\nProject: 25%\nHomework are coding assignments, they are usually only basic application of the concepts in lectures.\nNote that for tutorials, you would need to write up your own answer and submit your answer in teams. It was not a problem for me, because I enjoyed the content. All I needed to do was to listen attentively in tutorials.\nThere are 4 quizzes along the way, they are usually just basic questions on lecture content. I don't agree with all answers, partly on how questions are interpreted.\nWeirdly enough, there is midterm exam but no final exam.\nFor the project, my team did a Xiangqi engine. It was entirely algorithm-based, no machine learning, no learning agent. In fact, we learned after Pikafish, an engine derived from Stockfish, to make our engine. It was a fun being able to make such an engine and showing it to my Xiangqi members.",

You would learn things like git, swe cycles, architectural styles, project management.\nTake note that this module is a compulsory module under CS breadth and depth, so there are people of all kinds.

I can't say too much about how useful this is when it comes to working in the industry.\nThere are two projects you need to do: individual project and team project. For individual project, do not spend too much time on perfection, because you would only get an S/U grade for this component (i.e. you receive full marks or a very low score). For team project, make sure that you know all the grading components before launching into doing the project. It does not require a wow-factor, but rather you must demonstrate that you can fulfil all aspects of software engineering.\nI would say that if you want to go into software engineering, you should try to do projects outside alongside this module. You would dread software engineering if this is the only project you do in the semester.\nOn the bright side, I did learn a lot of useful things.

And looking at the live scoreboard was pretty stressing. In the end, it turns out that the dataset contained a lot of noise, we were supposed to figure that out and removed some features (i.e. columns of the input data) so that the model could perform better. A lot of my friends also could not figure that out, and for me, I scored almost on the other end of the spectrum.\nDo be prepared for the finals, understanding of the concepts is not enough.
